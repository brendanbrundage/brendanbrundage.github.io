A Simple Model of Group Conflict, Inequality, and Stratification. (with Daniele Tavani), *Review of Black Political Economy* (Forthcoming). [Link](https://doi.org/10.1177/00346446241275229}){: .btn--research}

> We present a simple equilibrium model of group conflict that formalizes several key insights of stratification economics. To begin with, discrimination is a purposeful activity pursued by dominant groups in order to maintain their status in society. However, not every member of the dominant group needs to fully engage in discriminatory efforts. In other words, dominant-group members can free ride on discriminatory actions taken by members of the same group. At the same time, though, someone must have discriminated, otherwise discrimination would not exist in equilibrium. We also show that discrimination is wasteful from a societal standpoint; yet, it persists because of the dominant group’s interest in maintaining their status, the fact that marginalized groups’ agency in lessening the effects of discrimination has costs, and the costly and imperfect nature of antidiscrimination enforcement. In particular, when the burden of proving discriminatory behavior falls on individuals in the marginalized group, discrimination will never be completely removed. Finally, we highlight how racial income inequality reverberates into wealth inequality (i.e., stratification), and we discuss the role of reparations in mitigating such outcomes.

A Decline in International Income Inequality? Cross-National Income Convergence Revisited. (with Anthony Roberts), *Sociology of Development*, 9 (4), 408–432. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1525/sod.2023.9.4.408){: .btn--research}

>Prior research shows global income inequality declined over the last few decades because of a reduction in income disparities between countries. However, concerns over the sustainability of this trend have grown with increases in income disparities within countries. Yet, despite these contrasting trends, few studies examine the extent to which the latter affects the former. Based on dynamic panel models of 108 countries from 1981 to 2017, we find that the rate of convergence in incomes between countries is moderated by the income inequality within countries. The national incomes of egalitarian countries are converging, while the national incomes of inegalitarian countries tableare diverging. Overall, this study calls into question the sustainability of decreasing international income inequality amid increasing national income inequality. More importantly, it shows that national redistribution policies are increasingly important in the twenty-first century, not only to reduce income disparities within countries but also to potentially reduce income disparities between countries.
