  <p>  Welcome. My name is Brendan Brundage and I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics at Morehouse College. 
</p>
    
 <p>   
I have a Ph.D. in Economics from Colorado State University. Before that, I received my masters' degree in Economics at Florida Atlantic University, and my bachelors' degree in Economics from Rollins College. I played four years of college baseball and now I enjoy playing basketball and golf in my free time.
</p>
    
<p>
My primary research is in Economic History, History of Economic Thought, and Stratification Economics. In general, my work seeks to explain differential development patterns for specific groups, like the racial wealth gap in the United States, as well as for developing regions, such as the Caribbean. My academic work has been published in <em>Economy & Society</em>, <em>The History of Polical Economy</em>, <em>The Review of Black Political Economy</em>, and <em>Sociology of Development</em>. You can find more information about my work in the <a href="https://brendanbrundage.github.io/research/">Research Page</a>.
